# Pomodoro Timer

![Demo](pomodoro.gif)

This a pomodoro timer website I built to help stay on top of studying. It is designed to be interative and switch between short and long breaks as well as allow the user to change the times or go by the default times. 

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I focused on creating a clean, responsive design that works well on both deskstops and mobile.
